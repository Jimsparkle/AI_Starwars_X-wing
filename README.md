# Self-Pilot X Wing Programme
Can the force be with AI to destroy death star by deep learning?

Supervised machine learning to self-pilot X-wing to travel back and forth in the battlefront.

Model developed using Tensorflow, Tensorboard, CNN model of modified Alexnet.
I only use 1 hour to play this game to record some training data so the training set is rather small. This partially explain why the AI is not able to deal effective demage (my bad gaming skill also counts, I guess...)
